## Design Decisions:
The largest design decision made was regarding how to store our data (the structure of the firestore schema). We know that we want a user to be able to grab all of their to-do list items. We noticed that in future labs, we have to have the ability to support individual users having their own lists separate from others (instead of a singular global list shared amongst all users). Furthermore, every user must be able to have multiple lists. Thus, we preemptively prepared for these cases. Our structure is as follows: we have a Users collection and for each user document, we have an multiple subcollections, where each one represents a list. For now, a user document just consists of a name property and an array that stores the string names of the user's lists. The default global user has a name of "user" with id "User". Within the lists subcollections, there are item documents that have the properties id, text, completed, priority, and created. Thus, the path to the global list of item documents would look something like "Users/User/Items" if one of the lists was called "Items".

Another design decision we made in this iteration was how to display the priority of a list item to the user. There were several options we considered, but we went with having a small color tab on the left end of the item to showcase the priority. We used color pscyhology/convention (green = good/low priority, red = bad/high priority) for the various priority colors while also making sure that these small color indicators did not mix up our color scheme by taking up too much space.

Additionally, we changed the header of our app to support users creating multiple lists. The header now contains a dropdown and group of buttons to allow users to select, edit, add, and delete different ToDo lists. For the layout of this header, we ultimately decided on using a simple center-grouped row of buttons next to the dropdown so that the header looks unified on both large and small screens. The icon buttons for editing, adding, and deleting lists were also made big and spaced apart to distinguish from the icon buttons used in the task items themselves.

Another design decision was adding looking at the past lab's rubric and seeing if we could add the various quality-of-life features that we missed out on. This includes greying and having text strikethrough for completed items, having task name focused when adding or editing a task, adding a delete confirmation, implementing undo for all add/edit/delete operations, allowing the return key to accept text, only showing relevant buttons if applicable (undo and remove completed), having empty text when there are no items in a list, and long task name wrapping.

A final design decision we made in this iteration was how we would allow the user to choose the order of displayed items. We added a dropdown button next to the show and remove buttons below the title so that users could select the sorting order. Users can now sort by priority ascending/descending, date created ascending/descending, or name/text ascending/descending. To maintain consistency, we also changed the show button to become a dropdown (before it was a toggle so users would have to click it multiple times to get to the one they want). Besides consistency, we also received user feedback about changing it to a dropdown instead of a toggle for easier use.

## Alternative Designs:
One alternative design was to have item background color changes for the priority, instead of our current design of having a small color tab on the side of the item. However, we had a difficult time finding colors suitable for this. We believe the white background of the item fits the light blue background of the app background. The small priority tab color is enough of an indicator that does not mess with the color scheme. We found that changing the entire background of the item made the app look aesthetically displeasing and scrambled the color scheme.

## User Testing:
For user testing, we again followed the guidelines stated in the readings.

User 1: One key improvement that this user helped to derive was changing several of our toggle buttons into dropdown selects. For example, for our show state that can be toggled between "All", "Completed", and "Uncompleted", we originally had a single button that users would have to click continuously to get to their desired show state. The test user expressed their annoyance at this, since they already knew what state they wanted but were forced to cycle through them all. Thus, we changed this and also made the sort state follow this dropdown select style. They also mentioned that our top bar with the list select and list add/edit/delete buttons made sense since they were all grouped together in the darker blue header box. We intended for this proximity and are glad to see it be intuitive for this user. Overall, the user found the button icons and dropdowns to make sense and correctly do what they are intended to do. Some aspects of improvement they noted was that the priority color tab could be made more apparent regarding what it represents and also the data created of an item should be listed somewhere. These issues both stem from the fact that our dimensions are small and we have limited space in an item component. However, we will take this into account and consider having a hover over the priority tab explain that it represents priority and also include a small date text on the right side of the item.

User 2: This user also helped us in adding an important feature within our interface. The user stated that there should be a better way to safeguard their data since if something is deleted, there is no way to recover it. From this feedback, we added both a delete confirmation and also an undo button. Thus, when a user tries to delete something, there is a modal that pops up that asks them to confirm the deletion. Furthermore, even if the item or list is deleted, it can be recovered by simplying clicking the undo button (which is only visible if there is an undo to be done). Due to complexity issues and time, we did not implement redo functionality but that is possible for us to do in the next lab to further improve the ability of retrieving old data instead of outright losing it.


## Challenges:
One challenge was getting firebase hosting to work properly. Even after following all the writeup instructions, there seemed to be an error that caused a white page to be displayed instead of our app. However, after comparing with some other students in class, we were able to figure out the issue was with the "homepage" attribute in the package.json file. After removing it, our app was correctly hosted and displayed.

Another challenge was figuring out which functions to use regarding firebase and firerstore (i.e. how to grab all the documents we need, how to filter out certain documents, how to edit specific documents, etc.). However, we were able to consult the documentation and also the in-class work on firestore to successfully implement the necessary firestore functionalities.

## Parts Of Design We Are Proud Of:
One part of the design we are proud of is our priority color tab indicator to show the priority level of a list item. The small indicator on the side of the item did not detract from our blue color scheme while still conveying the necessary information. We were also proud of our ability to plan ahead and model our firestore data in a way that would make it easier for future functionalities.
